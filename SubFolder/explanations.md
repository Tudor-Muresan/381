<h1 align=center> Explanations for HTML Assignment </h1>

### Of the list of five elements required for a B grade, the following are directly incorporated in the [previous document](/HTML_Project/Tudor_Muresan_30095500.md).

1. A title that is centered.
2. A picture to the right of some text.
3. Text with a different colour.
5. Part of the text that requires either a subscript like VO<sub>2</sub> or **superscript** like Na<sup>+</sup>.

<h3> Not incorporated verbatim is #4, "A hyper-link to [another document] (readme.md) </h3>

This is since I link to a document of a different name. Either this one or ["A Concise History of Romania" by Keith Hitchins](/SubFolder/A_Concise_History_of_Romania.pdf).

### Hyperlink will access a file in a sub-folder.

I do this thrice in the previous document, each time to the same sub-folder. 

### You will need to write V&#775;O<sub>2</sub> properly with the dot over the V&#775;. 

Again, I do not do this verbatim, as the V&#775; does not appear in the previous document. Instead, I use the same code as the one just used to add the accent atop the "a" in the Romanian sub-title "Coarana de O&#539;el a Roma&#770;niei". The same procedure was used. Please note that the accent below the "t" in the same phrase uses the unicode of that accented letter ["T-comma"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C8%9A) instead of the same procedure due to alignment errors relating to the colouring of the phrase in the previous document.

> I hope that, though the instructions weren't followed verbatim, my understanding of the code (and my showcase of it here) is enough for an A+ grade.
