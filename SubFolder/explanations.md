<h1 align=center> Explanations for HTML Assignment </h1>

### Of the list of five elements required for a B grade, the following are directly incorporated in the [previous document](/HTML_Project/Tudor_Muresan_30095500.md).

1. A title that is centered.
2. A picture to the right of some text.
3. Text with a different colour.
4. Hyperlink to another document. 
5. Part of the text that requires either a subscript like VO<sub>2</sub> or **superscript** like Na<sup>+</sup>.

### You will need to write V&#775;O<sub>2</sub> properly with the dot over the V&#775;. 

I do not do this verbatim, as the V&#775; does not appear in the previous document. Instead, I use the same code as the one just used to add the accent atop the "a" in the Romanian sub-title "Coarana de O&#539;el a Roma&#770;niei". The same procedure was used for the accent below the "t".
